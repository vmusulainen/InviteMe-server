# "Invite Me" service
The "Invite Me" service allows to get invites on an mobile phone to coffee, fast-foods etc. with personal discount.

### Scenario One: "Coffee lover"
Imagine that you walk on the street and you have installed the "Invite Me" app on your smartphone. When you are near a cafe, the invite from this cafe is sent to your smartphone. You hear sound of the notification, click on the notification and see that this cafe offers you a cap of coffee with discount 10% (or 15%). You can accept the invite or decline it.

### Scenario Two: "Tourist"
You are tourist and arrived to an unfamiliar city. Where are you going to go? Museums and galleries? Sure, but you can missed a lot of intresting: street performances, roof excursions etc... You have a solution: get your smartphone and run the "Invite Me" app. And you will get invites to such events. For example, small street band is about to begin of performance and band's producer create the invite "We start thge performance in ten minutes. Come to us!". All people around which have installed the "Invite Me" app, all of them get this invite and come to place of performance.
